## What is Confluence?
A wiki application. Software designed for collaborative editing in a browser.

## Confluence Terms You Need to Know
**Space**: A collection of related pages, often used to organise content by project, team, or department.

**Page**: The primary content in Confluence, used to document information, ideas, or project details.

**Templates**: Pre-made page formats for specific use cases (e.g., meeting notes, project plans) to streamline content creation.

**Macros**: Dynamic tools that add extra functionality to pages, such as embedding videos, creating tables, or adding task lists.

**Blueprints**: A type of template that offers more structure for common Confluence use cases, like blogs or retrospectives.

**Hierarchy**: The organisation of pages in a parent-child structure, allowing nested pages within a space for easy navigation.

**Comments**: Feedback that users can leave on pages or specific parts of content to encourage collaboration and discussion.

**Labels**: Tags added to pages for improved categorisation and searchability.

**Attachments**: Files added to pages to provide supplementary information or resources.

**Permissions**: Access controls for spaces and pages, managing who can view, edit, or comment.

**Search**: Confluence’s search function allows users to find pages, spaces, and content across the platform.

**Page History**: Tracks versions of a page, allowing users to view and revert to previous versions if needed.
